# ST3189 Machine Learning Coursework Repository

This repository contains code and resources for various machine learning tasks including classification, regression, and natural language processing (NLP).

## Folders

### 1. Classification
This folder contains the code for performing classification based upon the research questions for the Adult dataset.
The Adult dataset, also known as UCI Adult Census Income or simply "adult", is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine
learning tasks like classification. It originated from the 1994 U.S. Census data and contains anonymized
demographic information along with an individual's annual income label.

Research Questions:
1. How does Resampling Techniques affect a imbalanced Dataset
2. How would Pruning a Decision Tree affect the model

### 2. Regression
This folder contains code for performing regression task based upon the research questions for the abalone dataset.
The Abalone dataset, aims to predict the age of abalones based on physical characteristics. Abalones are marine mollusks with a spiral shell, and determining their age is crucial for fisheries
management. The dataset includes attributes like sex, length, diameter, and weights. The primary task is regression, predicting
the age (in rings) of abalones based on these features.

Research Questions:
1. How would removing outliers affect the model?
2. Does the data fit a linear model?
3. Would a non-linear model make a better model?

### 3. NLP
This folder contains code for performing sentiment analysis and topic modelling on the 1 million news headlines over a period of 19 years from Australian news
Source ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)

Research Questions: 
1. What are the main topics covered by ABC News over the past 19 years?
2. Can we leverage on Large Language Model (LLM ) models to interpret the topics?

### 4. Final Deliverables
This folder contains the final deliverables of the coursework, including:

- **Merged Code File**: A file containing the merged contents of all three task codes.
- **Research Paper**: A document outlining the research conducted, methodologies used, results obtained, and conclusions drawn from the coursework.

## Usage
You can navigate to each folder to find specific code related to the respective task. Feel free to explore, experiment, and modify the code to suit your needs.
